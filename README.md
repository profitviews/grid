# Grid Bot

This repo is a set of Python files to complement the Webinar held by [ProfitView](https://profitview.net) in collaboration with [BitMEX](https://bitmex.com) on 13 November, 2023:

[How to Create Your First Trading Bot in 30 Minutes](https://lu.ma/bot-trading-webinar)

Please feel free to watch the webinar recording.

In order to make the most of it, you may want to create your own algos on the basis of what's here.

To do that you need to:

1. Get an account with [BitMEX](https://bitmex.com) and transfer some funds to it ($100 or so will do to start with)
2. [Sign-up to ProfitView](https://profitview.net/register)
3. Choose a [Plan](https://profitview.net/app/settings/plans) - you will need at least 'Hobbyist'
5. Go to ProfitView's [Exchanges settings](https://profitview.net/app/settings/exchanges) and select exchange BitMEX. 
4. Create [BitMEX API Keys](https://www.bitmex.com/app/apiKeys) - choose `Order` Key Permissions.
6. Add your BitMEX API Keys in the ProfitView Connect Exchange popup

You can now copy the code from this repo into your Trading Signals editors.  Code is in `src`.  The code from the Webinar is in `src/webinar1`.

*Make sure you understand what the code is doing before you run it*

Make sure you agree with [ProfitView's Terms of Service](https://profitview.net/terms-of-service)
